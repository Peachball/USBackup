Note: There is no need to read this tutorial if you are using mobile internet (3G/4G/Surf Sticks/etc..), opening ports is sadly not possible with these kind of connections.

Tutorial for DSL/Cable users:

1. Find out which router you have. If you do not know what a router is then click the link below to see some pictures:

2. Open the following website:
http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/CnCNet/default.htm

3. Choose your Router manufacturer from the list.

4. Choose the model number/name from the next website.

5. Follow the instructions and open your port:
Name: CnCNet
Source-Port(start): 8054
Dest-Port(end): 8054
Protocol(type): UDP

Note: Additional firewalls (Comodo/Norton/F-Secure/etc..) usually cause problems with many programs, make sure to set your firewall up properly. The original windows firewall will not cause any problems.
