##### Frequently Asked Questions #####


Q: The game will only show a small screen, how can I make it full screen ?

A: Check your graphic driver settings and enable stretching/scaling. Also disable "Use letter- or windowboxing to make a best fit" in RedAlertConfig.exe(Settings)
Note: The first single-player missions are very small, they might look weird if you choose a too high resolution(small screen surrounded by black)!


Q: I get an "Unable to set video mode" error, how can I start the game?

A: If you get this error it either means your PC does not support the chosen resolution (use RedAlertConfig.exe(Settings) to change the resolution) or it might be a problem related to the CnC-ddraw. If all other resolutions also end up with the same error try one of the following options:

1. Disable ddraw: Open RedAlertConfig.exe(Settings), go to "video options" and enable DDwrapper. If the problem still persists try to disable both, CnC-DDraw and DDwrapper. (Note: The game might run unstable without CnC-DDraw and DDwrapper)
2. Play in window mode: Open RedAlertConfig.exe(Settings), go to "video options" and check "run in windowed mode"


Q: How to play in High Resolution?

A: Click the Settings Button and go to Video options to change the resolution


Q: I got Video/Sound problems (delayed/choppy playback), how can I fix it?

A: Click the Settings Button, go to "Video options" and Disable "Force Single CPU affinity"


Q: I'm using Windows 8 and the game won't start, how can I make it working ?

A: Click the Settings Button, go to "Video options" and Disable "CnC-DDraw" and "DDwrapper"


Q: When I try to play an online game I always end up with a "Other system not responding" error, how I can solve this ?

A: Allow the game(ra95-spawn.exe) and CnCNet(cncnet5.exe) in your Anti-Virus/Firewall. If you still keep getting the error then disable your Anti-Virus/Firewall and re-install the game to a -DIFFERENT FOLDER-


RA editor will ask you for the file main.mix if you choose "Mini CD-Installation", select your CD drive then

2.0 How to use the Hotkeys					
2.1 Bookmarks	
				
Ctrl+Space:					
Scroll over your Ore Refineries and press CTRL+SPACE. The next time when you press only SPACE the screen will jump to your Ore Refineries. This is very useful during a game to control your trucks and to tell them to collect only the closest ore. This will save you much money and it will result in a more efficient tank production.
				
Ctrl+W:					
Scroll over your War-factories and press CTRL+W. The next time when you press W the screen Will jump to your War-factories. During a game it is very important to produce tanks without any interruption. But the tanks are useless as long as u let them park around next to your War-factories. So bookmark your War-factories and press during a tank fight the W button to go to your War-factories select all new units and send them to the battlefield.
				
Ctrl+R:					
Scroll to your current battlefield and press CTRL+R. The next time when you press R the screen will jump to your battlefield. Imagine that you are in a close tank fight. You are producing tanks very nicely and you feel that you need reinforcements. Then you press W to go to your War-factories. You select all new tanks and then you must send them to the battlefield. Therefor you must only press R, target an enemy tank or building and all your new Tanks will arrive there very soon.

Ctrl+V:					
Scroll to the base of your enemy and press CTRL+V. The next time when you press V the screen will jump to the base of your enemy. This bookmark is Usefull for Air or any other sneaky attacks.

					
2.2 Q-ing					
Q-ing means that you can attack enemy units while your units don't stop moving.					
Select a single or a bunch of tanks. Hold the Q KEY and target an enemy unit. Now attack it while your finger is still pressing the Q KEY. Now click NEXT too your target on the map while your finger is still holding the Q KEY and you will see that your tank will drive to the last clicked position while he is still firing at the enemy unit. This is extremely useful because your tank takes much less damage when he moves while enemy units attack him.					
					
2.3 Shifting					
Shifting means that you add new tanks too an already existing group of tanks.					
1. Set your bookmarks W and R
2. Press W to go to your WARFACTORIES and press E to SELECT ALL tanks
3. Press CTRL+1 to put all these tanks into GROUP 1
4. Press R to go to your BATTLEFIELD and send the tanks
5. Press W to go to your WARFACTORIES and press E to SELECT ALL tanks
6. Press SHIFT+1 and then press CTRL+1 to add the new tanks into GROUP 1
7. Press R to go to your BATTLEFIELD and send the tanks

This is a bit complicated and you might need time to get used to it. Shifting is absolutely necessary to keep all tanks together and to Q them around.
				
2.4 Sidebar Scrolling					
I recommend to use D and F at the beginning of a game to scroll through the sidebar very quickly To built as fast as possible because speed is everything in this game.
